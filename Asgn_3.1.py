# Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay.
# Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
# Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
# You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number.
# Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
# Desired Output:
# 498.75
